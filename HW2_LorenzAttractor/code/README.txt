Homework 2 - Lorenz Attractor

This program (main.c) visualizes the Lorenz attractor, which arises from a system of equations that describe 2-D fluid flow. The attractor is governed by three primary parameters, r, b, and s. The program displays a line trace of the points that make up the attractor after 50,000 time steps. A circle and a line segment move along the drawn attractor to visualize the flow over time.

Key bindings for this program:
- arrows: Change view angle
- 0:      Reset view angle
- q:      Increase s by 1
- a:      Decrease s by 2
- e:      Increase b by 0.1
- d:      Decrease b by 0.1
- t:      Increase r by 1
- g:      Decrease r by 1
- r:      Reset attractor parameters (s=10, b=2.666, r=28)
- esc:    Exit
