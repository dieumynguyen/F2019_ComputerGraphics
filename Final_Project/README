Homework 6 - Textures

This program draws and displays the 3D of honey bees from homework 3, with the same projection settings from homework 4. Light is added from homework 5, and is moving by default but can be stopped and moved under control keys. The user can also change the smooth/flat shading, the emission, ambient, diffuse, and specular intensities, as well as the shininess. The wings of the bees have a veiny texture, and are also transparent using blending. The head and body of the bees have a fluffy texture to emulate the fuzz real bees have to trap pollen. 

Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: 15 hours

First-person perspective has mouse control enabled.
