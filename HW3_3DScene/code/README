Homework 3 - Scene in 3D

This program draws and displays a group of honey bees that are (statically for now) flying in space. There are 3 types of bees to represent the 3 main types in a colony: the workers (typically smaller), the queen (has a longer abdomen than workers, and is staying near the ground/origin), and drones (fatter than workers and queen). Each bee of any type is composed of a spheroid for the head, ellipsoid for the body, filled ellipses with appropriate rotations for the wings, and rectangular cuboids for the antennae. Each bee is a grouping of the generic objects, and is transformed with regards to the global space to be rotated/translated. 

Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: 24 hours (had a hard time with transformations and rotating wings)
