Homework 5 - Lighting

This program draws and displays the 3D of honey bees from homework 3, with the same projection settings from homework 4. Light is added, and is moving by default but can be stopped and moved under control keys. The user can also change the smooth/flat shading, the emission, ambient, diffuse, and specular intensities, as well as the shininess. 

Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: 30 hours
